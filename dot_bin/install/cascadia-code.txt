Installation

You can download the latest version of Cascadia Code from the releases page here:
https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases

Font formats:

* ttf variable: we recommend this version for all users, and particularly
  those on Windows or any other OS that employs TrueType hinting. It offers
  the greatest diversity of weight options (anything from 200-700).

* ttf static: in the rare situation where the above variable font version is
  not supported, or a singular weight is preferred to the entire range, static
  formats are supplied. However, please note they do not have the same degree
  of hinting quality as the variable font versions.

* otf static: for users who prefer OTF format fonts, otf static instances are
  provided. At this time we do not have a variable font OTF version.

* WOFF2: These versions are provided for the purposes of web use, and are
  available both as variable fonts, and static instances.

Once unzipped, right-click the font file and click Install for all users. This
will install the font onto your machine.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: If you have previously installed a version of Cascadia Code, please
uninstall the previous version prior to installing a new version. Not doing so
can result in improper rendering.
